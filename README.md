# Word-Shapes
A collection of small C programs that convert your command line arguments into little shapes, and even some for 4chan greentexting.

Compile with: gcc file.c -o filename

Remember to encapsulate your inputs with "'s if you want a sentence to be processed whole, instead of each in it's own square/shape.
